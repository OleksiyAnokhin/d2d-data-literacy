      <description>Mongolian participants provided an excellent feedback after participation in the D2D workshop “Natural Resources Data Analytics for Transparency and Stronger Social License”.
D2D asked participants to evaluate the workshop itself, its relevance to the participants’ work, and satisfaction of the chosen tool (Flourish). Not surprisingly, the team received very positive results, where the majority of participants expressed very satisfaction as “Very satisfied” or “Satisfied”.
In addition, the team received several oral requests to organize more similar events in future.</description>
